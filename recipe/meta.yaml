  summary: An easy to use interface to gravitational wave surrogate models
  description: |
    GWSurrogate is an easy to use interface to gravitational wave surrogate
    models.

    Surrogates provide a fast and accurate evaluation mechanism for
    gravitational waveforms which would otherwise be found through solving
    differential equations. These equations must be solved in the 'building'
    phase, which was performed using other codes.
